# Project Name

My guess who is a simple version of the game where you with a few questions come to guess on a person, in this one using objects and arrays.

## The problem

I had two issues, the first one was that the question was stuck on one value ll of the time. After examining the code I saw I did a double take on that part of the code and after i removed a chunk from the code it worked.

I had another issue regarding the game always saying yes to every value even if it should be wrong. With that one I asked my team and had excellent help from one of my teammates.
